                  I am a B.Tech. Graduate from Delhi, India. I love teaching physics and maths.
                  After my graduation, I taught physics to underprivileged students. I am a great beleiver of the quote "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.".
                  That is what I have done during my very short teaching career. Apart from that I love coding and by fate I landed an Internship at Indian Space Research Organisation where I was introduced to Data Science.
                  Rest is history, now I taught my self Data Science and Math behind it. Now I am switching to data science as a full time job.
                  My goal is to work on exciting projects and cutting edge Research.
