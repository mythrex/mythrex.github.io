                  I am Shivam Kaushik, currently a Research Engineer at a AI
                  health startup based in Bengaluru, Karnataka. I mainly work on
                  computer vision problems. I specialize in using traditional
                  and recent computer vision algorithms. Having worked closely
                  with clinicians across India and aboad to develop an AI
                  assitive tool for fetal sonography. My personal goal is to
                  develop assistive AI that works for humans, and with humans.
                  Exploring new problem domains in the field of data science is
                  my hobbie. To quench my thirst for machine learning, I
                  constantly give Kaggle competions. If you want to make a team
                  in upcoming kaggle competition you may drop me an email at
